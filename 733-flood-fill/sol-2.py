# You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, 
# where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. 
# You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. 
# Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

# To perform a flood fill:
# Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
# Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
# Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
# The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
# Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

# Example 1:
# Input: image = [[1,1,1],
#                 [1,1,0],
#                 [1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
# Output: [[2,2,2],
#          [2,2,0],
#          [2,0,1]]
